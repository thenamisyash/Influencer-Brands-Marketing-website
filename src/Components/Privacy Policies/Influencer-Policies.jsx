                                    At Bounty and Threads we care about your privacy. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent. We do not disclose it to others except for the purpose of providing you with the services available on and through the Platform, meaning allowing you to buy and sell services, share the information you want to share on the Platform, pay for or receive products, post reviews, and interact with other features of the Platform.<br /><br />
                                    We collect information that you provide us or voluntarily share with other users, and some general technical information that is automatically gathered by our systems or third-party service providers, such as IP address, browser information and cookies to enable you to have a better user experience and a more personalized browsing experience.<br /><br />
                                    Information that you choose to publish on the Platform is not private, just like any information you publish online.<br /><br />
                                    Technical information that is gathered by our systems, or third-party systems, automatically may be used for Platform operation, optimization, analytics, content promotion and enhancement of user experience. We may use your information to contact you - to provide notices related to your activities, provide general updates, or offer you promotions related to our services - but we will not let any other person, including sellers and buyers, contact you, other than through your user account.<br /><br />
                                    The above are just the highlights. We encourage you to read more about information we collect, how we use it, understand what is the meaning of cookie (no, you can't eat it) and more in the long and boring version of our privacy policy below.<br />

                            <p> When you register on the Platform we ask you to provide certain personal information, including a valid email address, phone number, location, username, or social media profile name. We may collect additional information, such as physical address and additional authentication information, to provide you with the services you request (such as payment or withdrawal of funds or sending physical goods), or to ensure the Platform integrity (for example, prevention of fraud). If you choose not to provide your personal information, you will still be able to access some features of the Platform, but will not be able to register an account to use Bounty and Threads’s services.<br /><br />
                                In addition, we collect information while you access, browse, view, or otherwise use the Platform.

We also record all communications by Users through the Platform. We may also collect supplemental information obtained from third parties such as demographic and navigation data.<br /> <br />
                                Additionally, in order to improve your online experience at Bounty and Threads, we have implemented impression reporting.

                                When you visit the Platform, we may use industry-wide technologies such as "cookies" (or similar technologies), which store certain information on your computer and which will allow us, among other things, to enable automatic sign-in to the Platform, make your browsing more convenient and effortless, and allow us to test user experience and offer you personalized browsing or promotions. Cookies (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. The Platform uses cookies to collect statistical data about its use, to tailor the Platform's functionality to suit personal preferences, and to assist with various aspects of Platform operation. These files contain a variety of information such as information about webpages visited by you, the length of time you visited certain sites, data about how you came to visit particular sites, the scope and nature of those sites, areas viewed by you, and additional information.

                                You may set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. Information on deleting or controlling cookies is also available at www.aboutcookies.org (note that this website is not provided by Bounty and Threads, and we therefore cannot ensure its accuracy, completeness, or availability). It is important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, cookies may, in certain cases, save you from the need to enter usernames and passwords, and allow session continuity.

                                A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Platform but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies, the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.

                            <p>
                                If you would like to review, correct, update, suppress, restrict or delete personal information that you have previously provided to us, or if you would like to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (if this right to data portability is provided to you by law), you can contact us.<br /><br />
                                In your request, please make clear what personal information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your personal information suppressed from our database, or other limitations you would like to put on our use of your personal information. For your protection, we only fulfill requests for the personal information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.
                                We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.<br/><br/>
                                Please note that we often need to retain certain data for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transaction that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion). Our databases and other records may have residual data which will not be removed. In addition, we also may not allow you to review certain data for legal, security or other reasons.<br/><br/>
                                If at any time you believe that the Platform has not adhered to this privacy policy, please let us know. We will use good faith efforts to determine and correct the problem.<br/><br/>
                                If you are a resident of the European Union, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority about how we process your personal information.
